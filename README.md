# Knight-s_Journey
Let's say we have an empty chess board with a Knight on it. <Br>
  Can a Knight visit every square of the board without revisitting? Maybe. <Br>
  In this program I kinda deal with that problem. <Br>
  To make things work you have to input the board dimension (8 for 8x8 board) and the starting pos for the Knight. <Br>
  Then you will see a pygame window in which you can watch the Knight's Journey <Br>
  Switch to master branch. <Br>
  There are 3 files and their names kinda speak for themselves; <Br>
  **Works poorly on Windows.**
